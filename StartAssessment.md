# SMKitUI Android SDK: Assessment

This guide covers the full flow for starting a Sency Blueprint Assessment and handling results.

## Overview
Sency Blueprint Assessments are standardized tests developed by Sency’s medical and fitness experts. You can also run custom assessments (see CustomizedAssessment.md).

## Prerequisites
- SDK configured (see README.md)
- CAMERA permission in AndroidManifest.xml

## Starting an Assessment
```kotlin
smKitUI.startAssessment(
    assessmentType = Fitness, // or 360, Strength, Cardio, Custom
    listener = object: SMKitUIWorkoutListener {
        override fun handleWorkoutErrors(error: Error) { /* handle error */ }
        override fun workoutDidFinish(summary: WorkoutSummaryData) { /* handle summary */ }
        override fun didExitWorkout(summary: WorkoutSummaryData) { /* handle exit */ }
        override fun exerciseDidFinish(data: ExerciseData) { /* handle exercise end */ }
    },
    userData = UserData(age = 28, gender = Gender.Female), // optional
    showSummary = true // show summary screen
)
```

## Assessment Types
| Name      | Description | More info |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Fitness   | Physical abilities, strength, endurance | [Fitness](https://github.com/sency-ai/smkit-sdk/blob/main/Assessments/AI-Fitness-Assessment.md) |
| 360       | Preventative/medical support | [360](https://github.com/sency-ai/smkit-sdk/blob/main/Assessments/360-Body-Assessment.md) |
| Strength  | Core/endurance strength | [Strength](https://github.com/sency-ai/smkit-sdk/blob/main/Assessments/Strength.md) |
| Cardio    | Cardiovascular | [Cardio](https://github.com/sency-ai/smkit-sdk/blob/main/Assessments/Cardio.md) |
| Custom    | Tailored by Sency | |

## Result Handling
- `workoutDidFinish(summary: WorkoutSummaryData)` — called when assessment ends
- `didExitWorkout(summary: WorkoutSummaryData)` — called if user exits early
- See DataTypes.md for result structure

## Custom Assessment
If Sency provided a custom key:
```kotlin
smKitUI.startAssessment(
    assessmentType = Custom("YOUR_CUSTOM_ID"),
    listener = myListener,
    userData = null,
    showSummary = false
)
```

## Troubleshooting
- Always call `configure` before starting an assessment
- Contact support@sency.ai for help
