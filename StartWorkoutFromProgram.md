# SMKitUI Android SDK: Workout From Program

This guide covers the full flow for running a Sency predefined workout program, including all options and result handling.

## Overview
Workout From Program lets you run Sency’s tailored workouts for specific clients. Contact Sency for your program ID.

## Prerequisites
- SDK configured (see README.md)
- CAMERA permission in AndroidManifest.xml

## Starting a Workout From Program
1. **Build WorkoutConfig** with your program details
2. **Start the workout**

### Example
```kotlin
val workoutConfig = WorkoutConfig(
    programId = "YOUR_PROGRAM_ID", // Provided by Sency
    week = 3,
    bodyZone = BodyZone.FullBody,
    levelType = DifficultyLevel.HighDifficulty,
    durationType = WorkoutDuration.Short,
    languageType = SMLanguage.Hebrew
)
smKitUI.startWorkoutProgram(workoutConfig, object : SMKitUIWorkoutListener {
    override fun handleWorkoutErrors(error: Error) { /* handle error */ }
    override fun workoutDidFinish(summary: WorkoutSummaryData) { /* handle summary */ }
    override fun didExitWorkout(summary: WorkoutSummaryData) { /* handle exit */ }
    override fun exerciseDidFinish(data: ExerciseData) { /* handle exercise end */ }
})
```

## Result Handling
- `workoutDidFinish(summary: WorkoutSummaryData)` — called when workout ends
- `didExitWorkout(summary: WorkoutSummaryData)` — called if user exits early
- See DataTypes.md for result structure

## Troubleshooting
- Always call `configure` before starting a workout
